More than 10,260 projects comprising 2TW of generator capacity and storage were actively seeking interconnection in the US at the start of this year, a massive increase of 700GW in 2022, according to a new report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

The combined 1.35TW of generator capacity and 680GW of storage in interconnection queues of the seven US regional electric grids and 35 largest utilities exceeds the 1.26TW installed capacity of the country’s plant fleet. The queues also exceed peak load demand in most of the regional grids.

  <h3>Factbox:</h3>
  <p>
    Only 82GW of capacity active in the queues was natural gas, vividly
    illustrating strong developer interest in solar, storage, and wind that is
    expected to further grow significantly in response to last August’s landmark
    federal climate law, which has $246bn in clean energy and carbon reduction
    tax credits over 10 years.

Solar has the most capacity (947GW), followed by storage (680GW) including hybrids, according to the report, [Queued Up: Characteristics of Power Plants Seeking Transmission Interconnection as of the End of 2022](https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/queued_up_2022_04-06-2023.pdf). About 300GW of offshore and onshore wind are in queues.

About 62% (1.26TW) of total capacity in queues has proposed online dates by the end of 2025 and 13% (257GW) already has finalised an interconnection agreement (IA).

### Strong Developer

Only 82GW of capacity active in the queues was natural gas, vividly illustrating strong developer interest in solar, storage, and wind that is expected to further grow significantly in response to last August’s landmark federal climate law, which has $246bn in clean energy and carbon reduction tax credits over 10 years.

With the typical project built in 2022 taking five years from the interconnection request to commercial operation, versus three years in 2015, the problem is getting worse, according to the report.

To obtain interconnection, projects must follow a study process in accordance with procedures approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the transmission and bulk sale of electricity in interstate commerce.

First, a project developer initiates a new interconnection request and enters the queue. A series of interconnection studies establish what new transmission equipment or upgrades may be necessary and assigns the cost of the equipment.

The study culminates in an IA, which is a contract between the grid operator or utility and the generation owners that lays out operational terms and responsibilities.

Most proposed projects are withdrawn for various reasons, which may occur at any point in the process. After executing an IA, some projects are built and reach commercial operation.

PJM, the nation’s largest regional grid, had the highest number of active projects in the queues (3,042), followed by the western states (1,879) outside of regional grids. ISO NE, New England’s organised grid, had the least, 350, followed by NY ISO (459), which serves New York State.

Among states, Texas has 13% of proposed solar, storage, and gas, and 7% of proposed wind; New York has 23% of all proposed wind (mostly offshore), and California has 14% of proposed storage.

The flip side is project completion rates are generally low. Only about 21% of US projects (14% of capacity) requesting interconnection from 2000-2017 reached commercial operation by the end of 2022, with lower completion rates for wind (20%) and solar (14%).

The backlogs and significant delays have caught the attention of the White House, where officials are lobbying federal and state regulators and grid operators to streamline processes.

The flip side is project completion rates are generally low. Only about 21% of US projects (14% of capacity) requesting interconnection from 2000-2017 reached commercial operation by the end of 2022, with lower completion rates for wind (20%) and solar (14%).\\

The overarching concern is that without interconnection reforms, clean energy adoption will fall short of both market demand being stoked by the climate law and required to help meet President Joe Biden’s ambitious headline 2030 climate goals for the US.

These include a 50-52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels, 30GW of offshore wind in operation, and emissions-free vehicles comprising half of new auto and light truck sales. By 2035, he is targeting a carbon-free electric grid.
