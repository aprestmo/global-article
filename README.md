## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Design System

Global shared first level variables live in `/public/styles/shared-global.css` at the moment. Corresponding `light.css` and `dark.css` are present at the same level. Brands have their own folder which gets conditionally loaded based on what page you are looking at.

To test variables, use `/public/styles/_main.css` at the moment.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `yarn dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `yarn build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
